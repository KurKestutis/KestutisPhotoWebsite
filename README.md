# KestutisPhotoWebsite

This is my personal website as a freelance photographer. 
Since I started learning programming I decided that my website should be made without any online website making tools. 
As well I decided not to use any snippet code and to write everything by myself from scratch. 
Write functions, play with CSS and make the website responsive to different screens. 
As a first attempt, I am satisfied. Later, of course, I would like  to optimize everything and use less duplicate code;)
